            Introduction
          </h2>
          <p class="normalWords">In this project, we sought to improve upon most of the pre-existing campaigns for energy saving on campus. While it is quite obvious that the school is taking measures to improve sustainability and raise environmental awarenss on campus, we questioned the effectiveness of their campaigns.</p>

          </h2>
          <h5 class="ui header">1. Empathise</h5>
            <p class="normalWords">To get a feel and sense of empathy towards how people felt towards sustainability on campus, we chose to do some simple research on existing solutions/campagins for sustainability on campus. This included walking around campus and taking notes of any campagin that we saw.</p>
          <h5 class="ui header">2. Define</h5>
            <p class="normalWords">We positioned ourselves as the school (HKUST), with a goal to raise campus sustainability, and to raise awareness towards sustainability in the student body.</p>
          <h5 class="ui header">3. Ideate</h5>
            <p class="normalWords">We brainstormed on pre-existing solutions. One of the tools used in this process was mindmapping.</p>
            <image src="./media/mindmap.jpeg" style="margin: auto"></image>
            <p class="normalWords">In the end, we chose to focus on improving the campaign for electricity consumption, as it is one of the most obvious areas which we could try to cut down on for sustainability.</p>
          <h5 class="ui header">4. Design Prototype</h5>
            <p class="normalWords">The first step towards designing an improved campagin for decreasing electricity consumption was to put ourselves in the school's, and students' shoes, and ask ourselves questions such as 1. Why don't the students care about sustainability? 2. What are some ways we can motivate students to decrease their electricity consumption?</p>
            <p class="normalWords">In the process, we came up with a handful of solutions, and drew out story boards for 4 of them. Here's examples of the first 2:</p>
            <div style="text-align: center; padding-left: auto; padding-right: auto">
              <image src="./media/storyboard1.jpeg" alt="Storyboard 1" width='75%'></image>
              <p style="color: #5A5A5A"><em>Storyboard 1</em></p>
              <image src="./media/storyboard2.jpeg" alt="Storyboard 2" width='75%'></image>
              <p style="color: #5A5A5A"><em>Storyboard 2</em></p>
            </div>
            <br>
            <p class="normalWords"><em><b>***NOTE***</b> We made a mistake in the project where we went ahead with designing several prototypes based on story board ideas, as opposed to developing a SINGLE idea. We are sorry we failed to understand this criteria.</em></p>
          <h5 class="ui header">5. Testing & Feedback</h5>
            <p class="normalWords">We had feedback & evaluation from peers for all 4 of the story desings to choose which <em>idea</em> to start from, as opposed to feedback on a particular design prototype.</p>
            <p class="normalWords">In the end we couldn't have any real feedback from anyone as we failed to deliver a single, focused prototype. Much of audience were quite confused as to what our project was about, due to our misunderstanding of the nature of the task.</p>

          <h2 class="ui header">
            Achievement at Each Milestone
          </h2>
          <p class="normalWords">During <b>empathisation</b> phase, we managed to put ourselves in the shoes of potential users. During <b>ideation</b>, we sought to utilize the mindmap as much as possible, putting forth ideas in a non-discriminatory manner, adopting a "no such thing as a bad idea" approach.</p>
          <p class="normalWords">The <b>testing and feedback</b> phase was the most consuming, as we had to find volunteers who were willing to invest time and energy into the evaluation of our products. However, I believe that we asked the right questions to draw out useful, constructive criticism from the volunteers.</p>
          <p class="normalWords">In <b>developing the prototype(s)</b>, we reminded ourselves that the first prototypes <em>does not have to be complex, or colorful.</em> Keeping this in mind allowed us to develop more than functional, working prototype. It is important to not get caught up in the details during the initial development of prototypes.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="ui divider"></div>
        <div class="contentDiv" id="reflection">
          <h2 class="ui header">
            Personal Reflection
          </h2>
          <p class="normalWords">I find it quite unfortunate that we missed the goal of this project (developing a <em>single</em> prototype, as opposed to many.) The story boards were difficult to construct at first, but once I had a better idea of the motivation behind darwing story boards, it allowed me to create clear, concise story boards that illustrated the need for the different prototypes.</p>
          <p class="normalWords">While conducting testing and acquring feedback was the most time-consuming part of the project, I recognize it as the most important part of the project. The end goal of product design should always be drwan back to <em>the user.</em> If the user fails to see a clear purpose behind the designs, the gap the design was trying to address will not be filled. Furthermore, testing & feedback allows us to optimize our product in terms of user-friendliness.</p>
